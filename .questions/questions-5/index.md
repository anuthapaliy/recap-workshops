Q: What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

A: Expressions are unique in meaning, while statements are two-sided in execution. For example, 1 has a certain value while go( ) may be executed or not. Statements are the whole structure, while expressions are the building blocks. For example, a line or a block of code is a statement.
